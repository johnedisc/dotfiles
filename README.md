#### this is simply a document that shows--myself more than anyone--that i have begun to

1. learn how to use a command line editor

2. learn how to customize it somewhat

3. learn about some amazing plugins to deal with git, language servers, fuzzy finding, and debugging

4. learn some basic things about how to write code

#### im proud of this, even though

1. i couldn't have done it without [tj devries](https://github.com/tjdevries) or [theprimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen)

2. this is just the very beginning

3. i barely know anything about anything
